    "Working on Problem 1 was an interesting exercise in understanding tree traversal and managing node data efficiently. Initially, I approached the problem by breaking it into two core tasks: performing a breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the binary tree and using a dictionary to track visited node values. I wanted my solution to handle edge cases gracefully, like an empty tree or a tree without duplicate values, while ensuring BFS covered all nodes systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "While implementing the solution, I leaned on Python's deque for efficient queue operations. The most challenging part was balancing clarity and efficiencyâ€”ensuring the logic was straightforward while keeping the time complexity at O(n), where n is the number of nodes. Testing helped confirm that the code worked for trees with different structures, from a single node to unbalanced, large trees.\n",
